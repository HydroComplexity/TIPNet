Description:
This MATLAB user interface takes time-series data as input nodes, and computes information theory based measures bewtween nodes as time-dependent links in a network.  See the user guide pdf for details on functionality and setup.

Documentation

Software required: Matlab

Open Matlab

Run the file "Entropy_GUImain.m"

Load a data file, project file, or generate chaotic test data.

Select filtering, time windows, and pre-processing options.

Run Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) program and save and plot results.

Note: some issues with plotting in the GUI may occur for various Matlab versions.  Please contact creator if you come across these issues.
